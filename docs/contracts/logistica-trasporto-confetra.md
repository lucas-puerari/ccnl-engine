## Review history

| Date | Reviewer | Scope | Outcome | Findings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-18 | maintainer (human) | Whole file. The values checked were not recorded. | confirmed | The review recorded no list of the documents it read. |
| 2026-10-11 | claude-opus-5-5 (ai) | Every payable rule of the file (55 records) read again in the signed testo unico of the renewal of 6 December 2024 (Verbale di accordo 25 September 2025), published by Confetra; the URLs the file cited return 404. | corrected | Corrected: every one of the 36 salary periods. The base salary is the minimo plus the EPA of the tables of pp. 80-81 for non-travelling staff; the file held values about 88-110 EUR too high. The printed Totale of the 1 January 2027 table already includes the minimo increase of 1 June 2027; the Legacoop circular of 19 December 2024 (p. 2) confirms that January 2027 is an EPA-only step, so the period holds minimo plus EPA.<br>Corrected: the Quadri receive the indennità di funzione of 51.65 EUR a month (Art. 6 c. 4, p. 17), which the file lacked.<br>Corrected: the daily quota is 1/22 (Art. 61 c. 3, Sezione prima, p. 86), not 1/26, which applies to a six-day week of non-travelling staff and to Sezione seconda (Art. 73 c. 5).<br>Verified: 14 monthly payments (Artt. 18-19), the accrual of fractions over 15 days (Art. 18 c. 2, Art. 19 c. 2), seniority (Art. 17) and 22 days of leave (Art. 24). Pages are PDF page numbers, equal to the printed ones.<br>Assumed: sickness. Art. 63 A) c. 7-12 keeps the job 245 or 365 days and pays 3 months in full and 5 at half (up to 5 years of service) or 5 and 7, counted over 24 or 30 months; the cumulation model holds one window in whole years for every band, so the rule is not expressible and the file's 100% for 180 days is wrong.<br>Left derived: the overtime rates (30%, 50%, 65%, 75%, Art. 13 c. 6) match, but their start of 2023-05-01 is not stated; the level descriptions are paraphrases.<br>Not modelled: the EDR of Art. 60 c. 8 (10 EUR at level 3S, re-parametrised) for workers in service on 26 January 2011, which affects every entitlement, and level 6J and travelling staff. |
| 2026-10-13 | claude-opus-5-5 (ai) | Sickness rule of art. 63 A), now expressible with a window and steps per seniority band; readiness of the file. | corrected | The sickness rule was assumed (100% for 180 days, not the CCNL's): it is now 90 days in full and 150 at half within 24 months, comporto 245 days, up to 5 years of seniority; 150 in full and 210 at half within 30 months, comporto 365 days, above.<br>With no assumed or missing payable rule left and the salary tables, additional months, divisor and seniority verified on 2026-10-11, the file is promoted to reviewed. |

## Known simplifications

Each simplification below is a model limitation of the registry. An open limitation with a monetary impact (`yes` or `unknown`) makes every result it applies to not payable, with an `open_limitation` blocker; the result lists every applicable limitation in `assurance.limitations`.

!!! warning "logistica-trasporto-confetra/apprentice_seniority · seniority · impact unknown · open"
    APPRENTICE SENIORITY: the CCNL text read for this ruleset does not state whether apprentices accrue the level seniority increments or an amount of their own, and no apprentice amount is modelled. The engine pays no increment during the apprenticeship (provisional); the run is affected when the apprentice has matured increments the level pays.

    **Applies when:** `seniority` applies; the run takes the engine code path; contract type in apprentice.

    **Remediation:** Source the CCNL clause on apprentice seniority and model it as seniority_increments.apprentice_amount (zero when apprentices accrue none), then remove this note.

!!! warning "logistica-trasporto-confetra/grave_illness · sickness · impact yes · open"
    Art. 63 cc. 8, 12: sickness from the 'malattie particolarmente gravi' of INPS circ. 95/2016 is paid in full for 18 months and left out of the comporto count; the request does not say whether an episode is one, so the ordinary treatment applies.

    **Applies when:** a fact the request cannot express: never recorded on a run.

    **Remediation:** Add a fact for a grave illness episode and pay it in full for 18 months outside the comporto.

!!! note "apprentice_seniority_simplified · seniority · impact unknown · resolved"
    Apprentices accrue only the CCNL apprentice-specific seniority increment, paid in full: the apprenticeship percentage no longer reduces it a second time. A CCNL that declares no apprentice amount pays none and carries its own open limitation <ccnl_id>/apprentice_seniority, recorded when the level pays matured increments.

    **Applies when:** `seniority` applies; the run takes the engine code path; contract type in apprentice.

    **Remediation:** Resolved: the remaining CCNLs are tracked by their own apprentice_seniority limitation.

!!! warning "sickness_inps_daily_base · sickness · impact unknown · open"
    The INPS share of a sick day is the INPS rate times the CCNL daily quota of the current month, counted on the CCNL payable days. INPS computes it on its own daily base (retribuzione media globale giornaliera of the month before) and on calendar days. The worker's total for the day is the same; the split between INPS indemnity (outside the contribution base) and employer integration may differ, and with it the contributions.

    **Applies when:** `sickness` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Compute the INPS indemnity on the INPS daily base and calendar days of the INPS rules, with the pay of the month before, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "sickness_cumulation_window · sickness · impact unknown · open"
    The CCNL tier and the comporto are counted on the days of one episode and the relapses it continues. A CCNL that sums the sickness of separate episodes over a window (a calendar year, the last three years) can reach a lower tier or the end of the comporto earlier than the engine shows. The run is affected when an earlier episode outside the relapse chain is recorded.

    **Applies when:** `sickness` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Add the cumulation window of each CCNL to its sickness rule, with the source, and count the tier and the comporto over it.

!!! warning "provisional_ruleset · irpef · impact unknown · open"
    The run reads a tax ruleset marked provisional: the sources of its year are not published yet (budget law of the year; regional and municipal surtax resolutions), so the values are those of the year before, carried over. Rules in force by statute (the IRPEF brackets of art. 11 and the deductions of art. 13 of the testo unico of D.Lgs. 117/2026) carry over unchanged; any change of the budget law is not applied.

    **Applies when:** `irpef` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Replace each provisional ruleset of the year with the values of its published sources, drop its provisional flag, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "provisional_inps_ruleset · inps_employer · impact unknown · open"
    The run reads an INPS ruleset marked provisional: the INPS circulars of its year are not published yet, so the rates, the massimale and the minimale (and the hourly contributions of domestic work) are those of the year before, carried over. The indexed amounts change every January: the carried-over values understate them.

    **Applies when:** `inps_employer` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Replace each provisional INPS ruleset of the year with the values of the INPS circulars of the year, drop its provisional flag, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "tfr_compensation_apprentice_guarantee_fund · inps_employer · impact yes · open"
    An apprentice whose TFR goes to a pension fund or to the Fondo Tesoreria takes the 0.28-point relief of D.L. 203/2005 art. 8, but not the exemption from the 0.20% Fondo di garanzia contribution of D.Lgs. 252/2005 art. 10 c. 2: no source found says whether the apprentice rate (10% of L. 296/2006 art. 1 c. 773 plus NASpI and the integration funds) holds a Fondo di garanzia share to exempt. The employer contributions of the run may be overstated by 0.20% of the INPS base.

    **Applies when:** `inps_employer` applies; the run takes the engine code path; contract type in apprentice.

    **Remediation:** Find an INPS source on the Fondo di garanzia share of the apprentice rate, then exempt it with the other workers or record that none is due.

??? note "Coverage notes"
    STAFF: tables for non-travelling staff (clerical employees and sedentary workers). The CCNL also covers travelling staff (drivers engaged in international transport) with separate tables and rules — not modelled in this file.
    
    CONGLOBATED MINIMUMS: base_salary values are the conglobated monthly minimum pay (minimum pay table + contingenza per Art. 61 note + EPA). Primary check: Art. 61 of the consolidated text September 2025 — 'From 1.1.2001 the indennità di contingenza has been conglobated into the minimum pay tables together with the EDR of EUR 10.33 per month'. fixed_allowances is empty for all levels.
    
    HOURLY DIVISOR: 168 hours/month. Primary source: Art. 61 para. 3 consolidated text September 2025 — 'The hourly pay is obtained by dividing the monthly pay by 168'.
    
    TRANCHES: four tranches for level 3S: 1.1.2025 +120 (minimo 90 + EPA 30), 1.1.2026 +40 (minimo), 1.1.2027 +30 (EPA), 1.6.2027 +40 (minimo 10 + EPA 30). Source: the tables of pp. 80-81 of the testo unico of 25 September 2025 and the Legacoop circular of 19 December 2024 (p. 2).
    
    ICE: the Indennità di Copertura Economica (ICE) was a provisional element in force until 31.12.2024. It ceases from 1.1.2025 with the renewal taking effect. base_salary values do not include ICE (ceased element). The consolidated text cites net increases of EUR 230 at 3S compared to the previous pay including ICE — the difference from the algebraic sum of the tranches (EUR 290 from base without ICE) corresponds to the pre-existing ICE value for that level.
    
    ADDITIONAL MONTHS: 14 (tredicesima Art. 18 + quattordicesima Art. 19 consolidated text September 2025).
    
    SENIORITY INCREMENTS: biennial (24-month cadence), max 5 biennial periods. Amounts from Art. 17 consolidated text September 2025. Non-travelling staff.
    
    LEVEL 6° JUNIOR: abolished from 31.12.2025 (renewal of 6.12.2024, Confetra circ008-2025). All workers graded at 6J automatically promoted to 6°. Not modelled in this file.
    
    EPA: Elemento Professionale d'Area, a component introduced by the 6.12.2024 renewal. Included in base_salary values from 1.1.2025. Not shown separately because it forms an integral part of the minimum pay (it affects all contractual and statutory entitlements) — see Confetra circ283-2024.
    
    EDR: the EDR of EUR 10.33/month (agreement 26 Jan 2001) is conglobated into the minimum pay tables from 1.1.2001 (Art. 61 note). The EDR of Art. 60 c. 8 (10 EUR at level 3S, re-parametrised by level) for workers in service on 26 January 2011 affects every entitlement and is not modelled; the EDR of the 2021 agreement does not affect other entitlements.
    
    INPS: uses 2026-industria.json (TaxSector.INDUSTRIA). File already present — no changes to the tax file.
    
    APPRENTICESHIP: percentage type from TABELLA A consolidated text September 2025. 75% year 1 (m1-12), 85% year 2 (m13-24), 100% from m25. Eligible levels: 1, 2, 3, 3S, 4, 4J, 5, 6 (level Q excluded). Maximum duration 36 months. Source: Art. 106 + TABELLA A consolidated text 09/2025 (contrattotrasporti.it).
