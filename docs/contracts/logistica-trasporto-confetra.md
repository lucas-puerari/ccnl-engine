## Coverage

### Funzionalità

Derived from the capability registry, as in the [capability matrix](capability-matrix.md).

| | Functional coverage of a layer: its weakest capability |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Every capability native: computed from bundled rules and request facts |
| 📝 | At best caller-supplied: a capability takes a caller rate or amount |
| ⚠️ | A capability is partial: some variants only, or data the file lacks |
| 🔲 | A capability is unsupported: the engine does not compute it |

| Layer | Status |

| **L1 — Gross** | 🔲 |
| **L2 — Net** | 🔲 |
| **L3 — Work rules** | 🔲 |
| **Limits of this contract** | seniority |

## Known simplifications

Each simplification below is a model limitation of the registry. An open limitation with a monetary impact (`yes` or `unknown`) makes every result it applies to not payable, with an `open_limitation` blocker; the result lists every applicable limitation in `assurance.limitations`.

!!! warning "logistica-trasporto-confetra/apprentice_seniority · seniority · impact unknown · open"
    APPRENTICE SENIORITY: the CCNL text read for this ruleset does not state whether apprentices accrue the level seniority increments or an amount of their own, and no apprentice amount is modelled. The engine pays no increment during the apprenticeship (provisional); the run is affected when the apprentice has matured increments the level pays.

    **Applies when:** `seniority` applies; the run takes the engine code path; contract type in apprentice.

    **Remediation:** Source the CCNL clause on apprentice seniority and model it as seniority_increments.apprentice_amount (zero when apprentices accrue none), then remove this note.

!!! note "apprentice_seniority_simplified · seniority · impact unknown · resolved"
    Apprentices accrue only the CCNL apprentice-specific seniority increment, paid in full: the apprenticeship percentage no longer reduces it a second time. A CCNL that declares no apprentice amount pays none and carries its own open limitation <ccnl_id>/apprentice_seniority, recorded when the level pays matured increments.

    **Applies when:** `seniority` applies; the run takes the engine code path; contract type in apprentice.

    **Remediation:** Resolved: the remaining CCNLs are tracked by their own apprentice_seniority limitation.

!!! warning "sickness_inps_daily_base · sickness · impact unknown · open"
    The INPS share of a sick day is the INPS rate times the CCNL daily quota of the current month, counted on the CCNL payable days. INPS computes it on its own daily base (retribuzione media globale giornaliera of the month before) and on calendar days. The worker's total for the day is the same; the split between INPS indemnity (outside the contribution base) and employer integration may differ, and with it the contributions.

    **Applies when:** `sickness` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Compute the INPS indemnity on the INPS daily base and calendar days of the INPS rules, with the pay of the month before, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "sickness_cumulation_window · sickness · impact unknown · open"
    The CCNL tier and the comporto are counted on the days of one episode and the relapses it continues. A CCNL that sums the sickness of separate episodes over a window (a calendar year, the last three years) can reach a lower tier or the end of the comporto earlier than the engine shows. The run is affected when an earlier episode outside the relapse chain is recorded.

    **Applies when:** `sickness` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Add the cumulation window of each CCNL to its sickness rule, with the source, and count the tier and the comporto over it.

!!! warning "provisional_ruleset · irpef · impact unknown · open"
    The run reads a tax ruleset marked provisional: the sources of its year are not published yet (budget law of the year; regional and municipal surtax resolutions), so the values are those of the year before, carried over. Rules in force by statute (the IRPEF brackets of art. 11 and the deductions of art. 13 of the testo unico of D.Lgs. 117/2026) carry over unchanged; any change of the budget law is not applied.

    **Applies when:** `irpef` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Replace each provisional ruleset of the year with the values of its published sources, drop its provisional flag, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "provisional_inps_ruleset · inps_employer · impact unknown · open"
    The run reads an INPS ruleset marked provisional: the INPS circulars of its year are not published yet, so the rates, the massimale and the minimale (and the hourly contributions of domestic work) are those of the year before, carried over. The indexed amounts change every January: the carried-over values understate them.

    **Applies when:** `inps_employer` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Replace each provisional INPS ruleset of the year with the values of the INPS circulars of the year, drop its provisional flag, then resolve this limitation.

??? note "Coverage notes"
    STAFF: tables for non-travelling staff (clerical employees and sedentary workers). The CCNL also covers travelling staff (drivers engaged in international transport) with separate tables and rules — not modelled in this file.
    
    CONGLOBATED MINIMUMS: base_salary values are the conglobated monthly minimum pay (minimum pay table + contingenza per Art. 61 note + EPA). Primary check: Art. 61 of the consolidated text September 2025 — 'From 1.1.2001 the indennità di contingenza has been conglobated into the minimum pay tables together with the EDR of EUR 10.33 per month'. fixed_allowances is empty for all levels.
    
    HOURLY DIVISOR: 168 hours/month. Primary source: Art. 61 para. 3 consolidated text September 2025 — 'The hourly pay is obtained by dividing the monthly pay by 168'.
    
    TRANCHES: four tranches at 1.1.2025 (+120 for 3S), 1.1.2026 (+90 for 3S), 1.1.2027 (+40 for 3S), 1.6.2027 (+40 for 3S). Source: contrattotrasporti.it/art-106-tabelle-retributive (Art. 106 consolidated text) and Confetra circ283-2024 (January 2025 tranche).
    
    ICE: the Indennità di Copertura Economica (ICE) was a provisional element in force until 31.12.2024. It ceases from 1.1.2025 with the renewal taking effect. base_salary values do not include ICE (ceased element). The consolidated text cites net increases of EUR 230 at 3S compared to the previous pay including ICE — the difference from the algebraic sum of the tranches (EUR 290 from base without ICE) corresponds to the pre-existing ICE value for that level.
    
    ADDITIONAL MONTHS: 14 (tredicesima Art. 18 + quattordicesima Art. 19 consolidated text September 2025).
    
    SENIORITY INCREMENTS: biennial (24-month cadence), max 5 biennial periods. Amounts from Art. 17 consolidated text September 2025. Non-travelling staff.
    
    LEVEL 6° JUNIOR: abolished from 31.12.2025 (renewal of 6.12.2024, Confetra circ008-2025). All workers graded at 6J automatically promoted to 6°. Not modelled in this file.
    
    EPA: Elemento Professionale d'Area, a component introduced by the 6.12.2024 renewal. Included in base_salary values from 1.1.2025. Not shown separately because it forms an integral part of the minimum pay (it affects all contractual and statutory entitlements) — see Confetra circ283-2024.
    
    EDR: the EDR of EUR 10.33/month (agreement 26 Jan 2001) has been conglobated into the minimum pay tables from 1.1.2001 (Art. 61 note). Subsequent additional EDRs (agreement 2011, agreement 2021) are NON-incidente (do not affect contractual entitlements) — not modelled in base_salary; they represent a separate pay slip item outside the engine.
    
    INPS: uses 2026-industria.json (TaxSector.INDUSTRIA). File already present — no changes to the tax file.
    
    APPRENTICESHIP: percentage type from TABELLA A consolidated text September 2025. 75% year 1 (m1-12), 85% year 2 (m13-24), 100% from m25. Eligible levels: 1, 2, 3, 3S, 4, 4J, 5, 6 (level Q excluded). Maximum duration 36 months. Source: Art. 106 + TABELLA A consolidated text 09/2025 (contrattotrasporti.it).
