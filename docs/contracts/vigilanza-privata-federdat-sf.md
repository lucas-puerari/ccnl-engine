## Known simplifications

Each simplification below is a model limitation of the registry. An open limitation with a monetary impact (`yes` or `unknown`) makes every result it applies to not payable, with an `open_limitation` blocker; the result lists every applicable limitation in `assurance.limitations`.

!!! warning "vigilanza-privata-federdat-sf/seniority_assumed_unchanged · seniority · impact unknown · open"
    SENIORITY: amounts from UILTUCS tabelle PDF (Tabelle-CCNL-16.2.2024_firmato-2023-2026.pdf), cadence 36m: A=29.00, B=26.00, C=22.00, D=19.00, E=17.50 EUR/scatto. July 9 2026 renewal (FEDERDAT-CONFIAL) increased maximum_count from 6 to 10; per-scatto amounts for SF not independently verifiable from a post-rinnovo public source (ilccnl.it shows Q–III for GPG only; SF behind registration). Values assumed unchanged pending primary source confirmation.

    **Applies when:** `seniority` applies; from 2026-07-09.

    **Remediation:** Confirm the post-rinnovo SF scatto amounts from a primary source.

!!! warning "vigilanza-privata-federdat-sf/apprentice_seniority · seniority · impact unknown · open"
    APPRENTICE SENIORITY: the CCNL text read for this ruleset does not state whether apprentices accrue the level seniority increments or an amount of their own, and no apprentice amount is modelled. The engine pays no increment during the apprenticeship (provisional); the run is affected when the apprentice has matured increments the level pays.

    **Applies when:** `seniority` applies; the run takes the engine code path; contract type in apprentice.

    **Remediation:** Source the CCNL clause on apprentice seniority and model it as seniority_increments.apprentice_amount (zero when apprentices accrue none), then remove this note.

!!! note "apprentice_seniority_simplified · seniority · impact unknown · resolved"
    Apprentices accrue only the CCNL apprentice-specific seniority increment, paid in full: the apprenticeship percentage no longer reduces it a second time. A CCNL that declares no apprentice amount pays none and carries its own open limitation <ccnl_id>/apprentice_seniority, recorded when the level pays matured increments.

    **Applies when:** `seniority` applies; the run takes the engine code path; contract type in apprentice.

    **Remediation:** Resolved: the remaining CCNLs are tracked by their own apprentice_seniority limitation.

!!! note "sickness_inps_daily_base · sickness · impact unknown · resolved"
    The INPS share of a sick day is computed on the INPS daily base of the episode, on the days INPS pays (the weekdays of an operaio, every day but the national holidays on a Sunday of an impiegato, point 7.3 of INPS circ. 134368/1981): the retribuzione media globale giornaliera of the month before the illness (INPS circ. 134368/1981 point 11; circ. 55/2024 Allegato 1), whole or partial month, impiegato or operaio, or for the lavoratori dello spettacolo the average pay of the last 40 daily contributions, capped for a fixed-term worker (INPS circ. 132/2021 par. 2.4). The base is a fact of the payroll history the episode states (SicknessEpisode.inps_base).

    **Applies when:** `sickness` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Resolved: the INPS share is computed on the base of every regime of the bundle; an episode that states no base the engine can read has the missing_fact issue sickness_inps_base_unknown (fact inps_base), which blocks the run. Tests: tests/integration/ccnl_engine/sickness/base/test_rules.py, tests/unit/ccnl_engine/sickness/base/test_rules.py.

!!! warning "sickness_cumulation_window · sickness · impact unknown · open"
    The CCNL tier and the comporto are counted on the days of one episode and the relapses it continues. A CCNL that sums the sickness of separate episodes over a window (a calendar year, the last three years) can reach a lower tier or the end of the comporto earlier than the engine shows. The run is affected when an earlier episode outside the relapse chain is recorded.

    **Applies when:** `sickness` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Add the cumulation window of each CCNL to its sickness rule, with the source, and count the tier and the comporto over it.

!!! warning "provisional_ruleset · irpef · impact unknown · open"
    The run reads a tax ruleset marked provisional: the sources of its year are not published yet (budget law of the year; regional and municipal surtax resolutions), so the values are those of the year before, carried over. Rules in force by statute (the IRPEF brackets of art. 11 and the deductions of art. 13 of the testo unico of D.Lgs. 117/2026) carry over unchanged; any change of the budget law is not applied.

    **Applies when:** `irpef` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Replace each provisional ruleset of the year with the values of its published sources, drop its provisional flag, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "provisional_inps_ruleset · inps_employer · impact unknown · open"
    The run reads an INPS ruleset marked provisional: the INPS circulars of its year are not published yet, so the rates, the massimale and the minimale (and the hourly contributions of domestic work) are those of the year before, carried over. The indexed amounts change every January: the carried-over values understate them.

    **Applies when:** `inps_employer` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Replace each provisional INPS ruleset of the year with the values of the INPS circulars of the year, drop its provisional flag, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "tfr_compensation_apprentice_guarantee_fund · inps_employer · impact yes · open"
    An apprentice whose TFR goes to a pension fund or to the Fondo Tesoreria takes the 0.28-point relief of D.L. 203/2005 art. 8, but not the exemption from the 0.20% Fondo di garanzia contribution of D.Lgs. 252/2005 art. 10 c. 2: no source found says whether the apprentice rate (10% of L. 296/2006 art. 1 c. 773 plus NASpI and the integration funds) holds a Fondo di garanzia share to exempt. The employer contributions of the run may be overstated by 0.20% of the INPS base.

    **Applies when:** `inps_employer` applies; the run takes the engine code path; contract type in apprentice.

    **Remediation:** Find an INPS source on the Fondo di garanzia share of the apprentice rate, then exempt it with the other workers or record that none is due.

    Apprenticeship: 100% passthrough confirmed from CCNL FEDERDAT Art. 86: "L'Apprendista ha diritto per tutta la durata del periodo di apprendistato all'inquadramento e alla corrispondente retribuzione del livello finale di collocazione." (FESICA PDF, CCNL ISTITUTI AZIENDE VIGILANZA PRIVATA, Art. 86). Engine models this correctly as 100% of destination level salary.
    
    ADDITIONAL MONTHS: 13 for Jun 2023-Dec 2023 (pre-quattordicesima); 14 from 01/01/2024 onward (quattordicesima introduced by rinnovo July 2023 renewal, per fiscoetasse.com). Level E: entry-level for first 9 months of tenure per contract text — correct by design.
