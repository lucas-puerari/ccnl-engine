## Known simplifications

Each simplification below is a model limitation of the registry. An open limitation with a monetary impact (`yes` or `unknown`) makes every result it applies to not payable, with an `open_limitation` blocker; the result lists every applicable limitation in `assurance.limitations`.

!!! warning "rsa-aiop/apprenticeship_under_classification · base_salary · impact yes · open"
    Apprenticeship: CCNL RSA-AIOP specifies sotto-inquadramento up to 2 levels below destination (levels A-F eligible, 36 months). Modelled as 100% passthrough (overstates pay for apprentices); the engine supports under_classification tracks with levels_below, not yet used here. (review of 2026-10-30)

    **Applies when:** `base_salary` applies.

    **Remediation:** Replace the 100% professionalizzante track with under_classification tracks (levels_below up to 2, 36 months) as servizi-postali-appalto-fise or tessile-smi do.

!!! warning "rsa-aiop/apprentice_seniority · seniority · impact unknown · open"
    APPRENTICE SENIORITY: the CCNL text read for this ruleset does not state whether apprentices accrue the level seniority increments or an amount of their own, and no apprentice amount is modelled. The engine pays no increment during the apprenticeship (provisional); the run is affected when the apprentice has matured increments the level pays.

    **Applies when:** `seniority` applies; the run takes the engine code path; contract type in apprentice.

    **Remediation:** Source the CCNL clause on apprentice seniority and model it as seniority_increments.apprentice_amount (zero when apprentices accrue none), then remove this note.

!!! warning "rsa-aiop/seniority_premium_2023 · base_salary · impact yes · open"
    Seniority: CCNL RSA-AIOP provides a flat EUR 40/month after 5 years of service (levels A-E3 only; F/G/H excluded). Modelled as cadence_months=60, maximum_count=1 — correct for new hires (single increment at month 60). The separate October 2023 seniority premium is modelled for employees with ten years at the same employer or group at signing (3 October 2023), using the caller-supplied employment start date as the start of group service. Earlier service at another group company must be reflected in that date; without a known start date the premium is not paid. Ratification is confirmed by the signed AIOP copy. The premium clause does not separately state a start date; 1 October 2023 is inferred from the agreement's effective date. No later replacement agreement has been verified; the 2023 agreement provides for continuation or annual renewal pending replacement, so the allowance remains open-ended pending evidence of a later change or absorption.

    **Applies when:** a fact the request cannot express: never recorded on a run.

    **Remediation:** Supply group-service start as the employment start date when earlier service with another group company qualifies. Verify any separately specified premium start date and any later replacement or absorption before changing the open-ended premium.

!!! note "apprentice_seniority_simplified · seniority · impact unknown · resolved"
    Apprentices accrue only the CCNL apprentice-specific seniority increment, paid in full: the apprenticeship percentage no longer reduces it a second time. A CCNL that declares no apprentice amount pays none and carries its own open limitation <ccnl_id>/apprentice_seniority, recorded when the level pays matured increments.

    **Applies when:** `seniority` applies; the run takes the engine code path; contract type in apprentice.

    **Remediation:** Resolved: the remaining CCNLs are tracked by their own apprentice_seniority limitation.

!!! warning "apprenticeship_pct_undeclared_components · base_salary · impact unknown · open"
    A percentage apprenticeship reduces every fixed allowance whose apprenticeship_pct_relevant flag the data leaves at its default, together with the base salary. Whether the CCNL applies the percentage to that allowance (an EDR, a contingenza, a function allowance) was not sourced. The run is affected when such an allowance is in the apprentice's pay.

    **Applies when:** `base_salary` applies; the run takes the engine code path; contract type in apprentice.

    **Remediation:** Source, for each CCNL, the elements the apprenticeship percentage applies to and set apprenticeship_pct_relevant on every allowance; the limitation then no longer applies to its runs.

!!! note "sickness_inps_daily_base · sickness · impact unknown · resolved"
    The INPS share of a sick day is computed on the INPS daily base of the episode, on the days INPS pays (the weekdays of an operaio, every day but the national holidays on a Sunday of an impiegato, point 7.3 of INPS circ. 134368/1981): the retribuzione media globale giornaliera of the month before the illness (INPS circ. 134368/1981 point 11; circ. 55/2024 Allegato 1), whole or partial month, impiegato or operaio, or for the lavoratori dello spettacolo the average pay of the last 40 daily contributions, capped for a fixed-term worker (INPS circ. 132/2021 par. 2.4). The base is a fact of the payroll history the episode states (SicknessEpisode.inps_base).

    **Applies when:** `sickness` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Resolved: the INPS share is computed on the base of every regime of the bundle; an episode that states no base the engine can read has the missing_fact issue sickness_inps_base_unknown (fact inps_base), which blocks the run. Tests: tests/mutation/ccnl_engine/sickness/base/test_rules_wiring.py, tests/mutation/ccnl_engine/sickness/base/test_rules.py.

!!! warning "sickness_cumulation_window · sickness · impact unknown · open"
    The CCNL tier and the comporto are counted on the days of one episode and the relapses it continues. A CCNL that sums the sickness of separate episodes over a window (a calendar year, the last three years) can reach a lower tier or the end of the comporto earlier than the engine shows. The run is affected when an earlier episode outside the relapse chain is recorded. A CCNL whose comporto the engine counts over the calendar year (Commercio Art. 186 and the others with comporto_calendar_year) is not affected.

    **Applies when:** `sickness` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Add the cumulation window of each CCNL to its sickness rule, with the source, and count the tier and the comporto over it.

!!! warning "provisional_ruleset · irpef · impact unknown · open"
    The run reads a tax ruleset marked provisional: the sources of its year are not published yet (budget law of the year; regional and municipal surtax resolutions), so the values are those of the year before, carried over. Rules in force by statute (the IRPEF brackets of art. 11 and the deductions of art. 13 of the testo unico of D.Lgs. 117/2026) carry over unchanged; any change of the budget law is not applied.

    **Applies when:** `irpef` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Replace each provisional ruleset of the year with the values of its published sources, drop its provisional flag, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "provisional_inps_ruleset · inps_employer · impact unknown · open"
    The run reads an INPS ruleset marked provisional: the INPS circulars of its year are not published yet, so the rates, the massimale and the minimale (and the hourly contributions of domestic work) are those of the year before, carried over. The indexed amounts change every January: the carried-over values understate them.

    **Applies when:** `inps_employer` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Replace each provisional INPS ruleset of the year with the values of the INPS circulars of the year, drop its provisional flag, then resolve this limitation.

!!! note "tfr_compensation_apprentice_guarantee_fund · inps_employer · impact yes · resolved"
    An apprentice whose TFR goes to a pension fund or to the Fondo Tesoreria takes the 0.28-point relief of D.L. 203/2005 art. 8 and no Fondo di garanzia exemption: the 10% apprentice rate of L. 296/2006 art. 1 c. 773 is split by the D.M. 28 marzo 2007 among FPLD 9.01, CUAF 0.11, malattia 0.53, maternità 0.05 and INAIL 0.30, with no Fondo di garanzia share to exempt.

    **Applies when:** `inps_employer` applies; the run takes the engine code path; contract type in apprentice.

    **Remediation:** Resolved: the apprentice rate holds no Fondo di garanzia share, so none is exempted.

!!! note "maternity_daily_base · maternity_leave · impact unknown · resolved"
    The INPS indemnity of the leave is computed on the pay of the month before, as the sickness base (art. 23 D.Lgs. 151/2001): an operaio's pay over the days worked or paid with the monthly share of the extra months over 25, a month not worked in full over its days worked or paid; the pay of the month before, its days and the pay of a whole month are facts of the leave, missing when not stated. The run keeps its own pay only when the category or the monthly payments of the CCNL are unknown.

    **Applies when:** `maternity_leave` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Resolved: the base of an operaio and of a partial month is the sickness base of the month before.

!!! note "paternity_daily_base · paternity_leave · impact unknown · resolved"
    The INPS indemnity of the leave is computed on the pay of the month before, as the sickness base (art. 23 D.Lgs. 151/2001): an operaio's pay over the days worked or paid with the monthly share of the extra months over 25, a month not worked in full over its days worked or paid; the pay of the month before, its days and the pay of a whole month are facts of the leave, missing when not stated. The run keeps its own pay only when the category or the monthly payments of the CCNL are unknown.

    **Applies when:** `paternity_leave` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Resolved: the base of an operaio and of a partial month is the sickness base of the month before.

!!! note "parental_daily_base · parental_leave · impact unknown · resolved"
    The INPS indemnity of the leave is computed on the pay of the month before, as the sickness base (art. 23 D.Lgs. 151/2001): an operaio's pay over the days worked or paid with the monthly share of the extra months over 25, a month not worked in full over its days worked or paid; the pay of the month before, its days and the pay of a whole month are facts of the leave, missing when not stated. The run keeps its own pay only when the category or the monthly payments of the CCNL are unknown.

    **Applies when:** `parental_leave` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Resolved: the base of an operaio and of a partial month is the sickness base of the month before.

!!! warning "parental_income_condition · parental_leave · impact unknown · open"
    The days of parental leave beyond the indemnified months (three of each parent and three of the couple, nine of a sole parent) are paid nothing: art. 34 c. 3 D.Lgs. 151/2001 pays them 30% when the parent's income is below 2.5 times the trattamento minimo di pensione, an income test and a yearly amount the engine does not model.

    **Applies when:** `parental_leave` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Source the yearly trattamento minimo and the income the test reads, take the income as a fact of the leave and pay the further days at 30% when the condition holds, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "parental_month_split · parental_leave · impact unknown · open"
    When a counter of the parental leave (a rate band or the indemnified months) ends inside a calendar month of the leave that is not of thirty days, the engine pays the days of that month in order, one day of counter each and the last day what is left of the thirty: INPS counts the calendar month as one month (FAQ congedo parentale 2024, n. 10) but no source says which of its days fall in which band.

    **Applies when:** `parental_leave` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Source how INPS splits a calendar month between two rates of the parental leave and apply it, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "parental_extra_month_share · parental_leave · impact unknown · open"
    The days of parental leave accrue the 13th and the other extra months in full at the employer's charge (art. 34 c. 5 D.Lgs. 151/2001: the leave does not reduce them), while the INPS indemnity is computed on a base that already holds their daily rateo (art. 23 c. 2, INPS circ. 122/2022): no source read settles whether the employer's extra month is reduced by the share INPS pays, so the rateo of a month on leave may be overstated.

    **Applies when:** `parental_leave` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Source how the extra months of a parental leave are split between INPS and the employer and net the INPS share from the employer's rateo, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "parental_hourly_ccnl_rule · parental_leave · impact unknown · open"
    A parental leave by the hour takes half the average daily hours a day and counts two such days as one day of leave, the general criterion of art. 32 c. 1-ter D.Lgs. 151/2001 (INPS circ. 152/2015 par. 2.2); a collective agreement, also of the company, that sets other hours to a day of leave or other rules of cumulation prevails, and the bundle holds none.

    **Applies when:** `parental_leave` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Source the collective rules on the leave by the hour of the CCNL (hours of a day of leave, cumulation) and apply them, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "disability_permit_tfr · disability_permits · impact unknown · open"
    The days of permit under L. 104/1992 art. 33 c. 3 keep the TFR base, as payroll practice holds; art. 2120 c. 3 c.c. keeps in the TFR base only the absences of art. 2110 c.c. and the wage integration, and no primary source read says the permits are among them, so the TFR quota of a month with permits may be overstated.

    **Applies when:** `disability_permits` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Source the TFR treatment of the permit days (an INPS or Ministry ruling, or case law of the Cassazione) and apply it, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "notice_indemnity_partial · termination_notice · impact unknown · open"
    A notice partly worked pays the share of its calendar days left of the indemnity the CCNL band gives in monthly pays; the CCNL clause read (Federmeccanica Sez. Quarta Tit. VIII Art. 1) states the indemnity of the whole notice only, and practice also measures the rest by 30ths or 26ths of the monthly pay.

    **Applies when:** `termination_notice` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Source how the CCNL or case law measures the indemnity of a notice partly worked and apply it, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "notice_indemnity_extra_months · termination_notice · impact yes · open"
    The indemnity is the monthly pays of the CCNL band on the monthly pay of art. 2121 c.c.; the 13th and 14th the notice would have accrued are not added, although art. 2121 counts 'ogni altro compenso di carattere continuativo', so the indemnity may be understated.

    **Applies when:** `termination_notice` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Source whether the indemnity carries the rateo of the extra months (CCNL clause or case law) and add it, then resolve this limitation.

!!! note "notice_indemnity_tfr · termination_notice · impact yes · resolved"
    The notice indemnity enters the TFR base only when the CCNL puts it there: the Cassazione holds that it is out of it, being referable to a period not worked after the end of the employment, and art. 2120 c. 2 c.c. leaves a different rule to the collective agreement.

    **Applies when:** `termination_notice` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Resolved: the indemnity is out of the TFR base unless the CCNL notice sets tfr_base true.

!!! warning "notice_indemnity_day_measure · termination_notice · impact unknown · open"
    A CCNL that sets the notice in calendar days measures the indemnity on the pay of those days: the engine takes a calendar day as a 30th of the monthly pay; Commercio art. 209 refers the monthly pay to all the days of the calendar month, but its art. 210 sets the daily quota at 1/26 'in tutti i casi', so the indemnity may be understated.

    **Applies when:** `termination_notice` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Source the daily measure of the notice indemnity of the CCNL (an interpretation of the parties or case law) and apply it, then resolve this limitation.

!!! note "extraordinary_leave_daily_base · extraordinary_leave · impact unknown · resolved"
    The daily indemnity of the extraordinary leave is the last monthly pay of fixed and continuous items times the monthly payments of a year, over 365 days (366 in a leap year), as INPS circ. 64/2001 par. 4 sets for a month worked full time; for a vertical part time the circular divides the pay of the month by its paid days, rest days included, which ExtraordinaryLeaveEvent.last_month_paid_days states. A vertical or mixed part time that does not state them is paid on the full-time measure, so its indemnity may be misstated.

    **Applies when:** `extraordinary_leave` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Resolved: ExtraordinaryLeaveEvent.last_month_paid_days divides the pay of a vertical part time by its paid days (INPS circ. 64/2001 par. 4); a leave that does not state them is paid on the full-time measure with the provisional issue extraordinary_paid_days_unknown, which names the fact.

!!! note "naspi_dismissal_exceptions · naspi_dismissal · impact unknown · resolved"
    The NASpI contribution of the end of an employment that does not state its case (EmploymentPeriod.naspi_case) is read from the cause, the just cause and the contract type alone: a resignation in the protected period of maternity and a mutual agreement before the labour office or on a transfer over 50 km would owe it (INPS circ. 44/2013 par. 1), a collective dismissal would owe 82% for an employer owing the CIGS contribution (L. 205/2017 art. 1 c. 137) and three times without union agreement (L. 92/2012 art. 2 c. 35), the changes of contractor with a social clause and the closures of a construction site of c. 34 would leave it out. The service counts the fixed-term periods before the open-ended contract and leaves out the leave of art. 42 c. 5 D.Lgs. 151/2001 only through EmploymentPeriod.started_on.

    **Applies when:** `naspi_dismissal` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Resolved: EmploymentPeriod.naspi_case states the cases that owe, leave out or multiply the contribution; an end that could be one and does not state it is decided from its cause alone with the provisional issue naspi_dismissal_case_unknown, which names the fact.

!!! warning "personal_withholding_same_kind · personal_withholdings · impact unknown · open"
    Two garnishments of the same kind, or two salary assignments, share the measure of their kind (a fifth, or the tenth or seventh of the agente della riscossione) in the order of notification: art. 545 c. 4 c.p.c. sets 'un quinto per i tributi ... ed in eguale misura per ogni altro credito' and art. 5 DPR 180/1950 a cessione 'fino al quinto', but no text read says how two orders of the same kind split the measure, so the later order may be under- or overstated.

    **Applies when:** `personal_withholdings` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Source how the employer splits the measure between two orders of the same kind (art. 499 c.p.c. on the intervention of creditors, case law of the Cassazione) and apply it, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "mid_month_level_change · base_salary · impact unknown · open"
    A promotion on a day other than the first of a month splits the monthly pay of the run between the level before and the new level by the payable days of the CCNL daily quota on each side of the promotion, component by component; the hourly quotas of the month (overtime, permits, absences) read the same split chain whatever the day of the event. The CCNL texts read (Commercio and Terziario art. 118, DMO art. 102) give the new level from the promotion but not how its month is split.

    **Applies when:** `base_salary` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Source how a month is split by a promotion inside it (a CCNL clause or an INPS or Ministry ruling) and price the events of the month at the terms of their day, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "arrears_unused_deductions · contract_renewal_arrears · impact yes · open"
    The engine computes the rate of the separate taxation of arrears from PriorYearTaxFacts.net_income_biennio (art. 21 cc. 1, 3 TUIR) and reduces the tax by ArrearsEvent.unused_deductions, the deductions of artt. 12 and 13 cc. 1-2 the worker did not use in the years the arrears refer to (art. 21 c. 4). An arrears event that does not state them, among which the una tantum the engine pays itself, is taxed without the reduction, so the tax may be overstated.

    **Applies when:** `contract_renewal_arrears` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** State ArrearsEvent.unused_deductions from the worker's declaration of the deductions used each year; for the una tantum, carry it into the events the engine generates.

!!! warning "una_tantum_readings · base_salary · impact unknown · open"
    The una tantum of a renewal is paid from the CCNL data with readings no text read settles in full: a month of service in the covered period counts with the days of the una tantum (15 when the text is silent), over the months of the period; the absences of a month do not reduce it, though a text may pay the months 'di effettiva prestazione'; a part time is paid in proportion to its hours; a run without the employment period is paid none; the share of the covered months of earlier years is taxed apart as arrears.

    **Applies when:** `base_salary` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Source the counting of the months, the part time and the taxation of each una tantum from its agreement, then resolve this limitation.

!!! warning "sunday_holiday_ccnl_clause · sunday_holiday · impact yes · open"
    L. 260/1949 art. 5 pays the workers with a fixed salary a further daily quota only for the civil holidays (25 April, 1 May, 2 June) falling on a Sunday; the other holidays of art. 2 (1 January, 6 January, Easter Monday, 15 August, 4 October, 1 November, 8 December, 25 and 26 December) give it only by CCNL clause, and the payment of 4 November is a CCNL institute. A run of a month with such a holiday on a Sunday, in a CCNL whose clause is not sourced (work_rules.sunday_holidays), pays the statutory holidays only; a public employment is paid none, its treatment not being sourced.

    **Applies when:** `sunday_holiday` applies; the run takes the engine code path.

    **Remediation:** Source the CCNL clause on the holidays falling on a Sunday and record it as work_rules.sunday_holidays.
